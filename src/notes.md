# strategy

Save all user settings in local storage, whenever the user logs in from a new device save them again (delete when logs out), command runner will look within the local storage _firsâ€ _, and if commands list not found there, will query Firestore.

Integrate some sort of fuzzy search.

Use service workers to load app immediately.
